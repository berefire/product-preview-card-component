## 📋Overview

The goal of this challenge was to build a responsive and accessible product card component that closely matches the provided design, using semantic HTML and modern CSS practices.

### 🎖️The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Navigate and interact with the component using the keyboard

## My process

### 🛠️Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology
- Local fonts with `@font-face`
- Accessible markup (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### ✨Features

- Fully responsive product card layout
- Clean and scalable CSS architecture
- Hover and focus-visible states for buttons and links
- High color contrast for readability
- Optimized images using `<picture>` and responsive sources

### 📚What I learned

During this project I reinforced:

- How to correctly structure components using **BEM**
- The importance of a **mobile-first approach** when building responsive layouts
- How to use `<picture>` for responsive images without breaking layouts
- Improving UI accessibility by handling **contrast, focus states, and semantics**
- Writing clearner CSS using custom properties and logical properties

### ♿Accessibility

This project follows basic **WCAG 2.1 AA** guidelines:

- Semantic HTML elements (`main`, `section`, `footer`, `address`)
- Sufficient color contrast for text and links
- Keyboard-accessible button and links
- Visible hover and focus states
- Meaningful alternative text for images

### 🚀Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility even further using ARIA only when necessary
- Explore more advanced CSS Grid layouts
- Refine micro-interactions and transitions
- Keep improving code readability and maintainability
